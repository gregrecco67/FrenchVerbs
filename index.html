<div>For (1), the infinitive will appear at the top (or you can enter your own). Fill in any verb forms you like and only 
    those will be marked, no accents required.</div>
    
<div class="fn">(If you want to enter accented characters, alt+c for cedilla, alt+e for acute, 
    alt+` for grave, alt+i for circumflex, alt+u for diaeresis, followed by the letter. Your browser or operating system may
    interfere with this. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
</div>
<div>
    For (2), you have to provide the infinitive ("head") and parse the verb form. Use the abbrevations below:
    <ul>
        <li>Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd</li>
        <li>Number: sg, pl</li>
        <li>Tense/mood: pres, impf, past, fut, cond, subj, subj impf, pres part, past part</li>
    </ul>
