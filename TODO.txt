-- imperative? participle?

-- tweak script to generate wordlist.txt, too
-- order correctly, w/o accents

-- replace the passe compose with the imperative
-- have spots for present and past participles and auxiliary verb

1. change pronouns: tu/nous/vous and pres/past/aux
2. change newQuiz variants (both) to put together imper/partic conj fields
3. marking looks the same(?)

-- update generate.py to include auxiliary verb
